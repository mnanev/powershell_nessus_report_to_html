📋 Description
This script automates the processing of CSV reports and creates HTML files with analyses for different risk levels (Medium, High, and Critical). The main functionality is to extract the newest CSV file from the InputData folder and generate reports in the Reports folder.

🚀 How It Works
1. Place your CSV report in the InputData folder. The script will only manage the newest CSV file in the folder.
2. Run Run.ps1.
3. After the script executes, three HTML files will be created in the Reports folder containing reports for Medium, High, and Critical risks.
